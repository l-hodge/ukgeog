## Overview

`ukgeog` is a simple package to facilitate the easy download of official spatial data sets of the UK. It includes a wide range of geospatial data, provided as [simple feature `sf` objects](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) (like shapefiles but better). Making it easy to make [Choropleth Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) with `base R`, as well as with popular packages such as [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

Other functions are provided to create UK Local Authority (LA) lookups, across time and between lower and upper tiers.  

## Installation

```{r, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("l-hodge/ukgeog")
```


## Downloading UK boundaries from the ONS

- `available_sf` returns a list of available boundaries

- `select_sf` can be used to interactively select a set of boundaries to download

- `read_sf` can be used to download boundaries for the following geographies using the 'geog' and 'year' arguments:

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(ukgeog)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

```{r, results = "asis", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
available_sf() %>%
    dplyr::group_by(geog, geog_short) %>%
    dplyr::arrange(year) %>% 
    dplyr::summarize(year = stringr::str_c(year, collapse = "; "), .groups = "drop") %>% 
    dplyr::select("'geog'" = geog_short, "Geography" = geog, "Year" = year) %>%
    knitr::kable()
```

### Basic Usage

```{r, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(ukgeog)

# Read in simple feature of the countries that make up the UK 
sf <- read_sf("NAT", year = 2021)

```

## Creating UK Local Authority lookups (2011-2021) 

- `across_yr_lookup` creates lookups across time to account for boundary changes
- `within_yr_lookup` creates within year lookups between LAD's and UTLA's

## Other functions

- `convert_lnglat` converts Eastings/Northings to Latitude/Longitude

Original shapefiles are created by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and are available from the [Open Geography Portal](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/).
