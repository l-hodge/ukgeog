`ukgeog` provides several `read_*` functions to provide the ability to easily download official spatial data sets of the UK as simple feature (`sf`) objects. A full list of the geographies available is provided [here](https://l-hodge.github.io/uk-geog/). Here we demonstrate how this makes it easy to make choropleth maps with base R, as well as with popular packages such as `ggplot2`, `tmap` and `leaflet.`

First we need to read in a spatial dataset as a simple feature (`sf`), here we choose to make use of `read_admin` to read in the countries that make up the UK:
```{r getsf, eval = TRUE}
library(ukgeog)

sf <- read_sf("NAT", year = 2021)
```

Note: ` crs = 4326 ` (the default) provides the most compatibility with other functions.

## Drawing a choropleth map with a simple feature

We first merge in mid-2019 population density estimates from the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/annualmidyearpopulationestimates/mid2019estimates#population-growth-in-england-wales-scotland-and-northern-ireland), so we have something to plot:
```{r population}
population <- data.frame(
                country = c("England", "Wales", "Scotland", "Northern Ireland"),
                `Population Density` = as.numeric(c("432", "152", "70", "137")),
                check.names = FALSE
              )

sf <- dplyr::left_join(sf, population, by = "country")

```

Now we plot some choropleth maps with both base R and some easier to use packages:

### base R (`plot`)

```{r plotexample, eval = TRUE}
cols <- c("#EDF8E9", "#BAE4B3", "#74C476", "#31A354", "#006D2C")
brks <- c(0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
col <- cols[findInterval(sf$`Population Density`, vec = brks)]

plot(sf$geometry, col = col)
legend("bottomleft", 
       legend = levels(cut(sf$`Population Density`, brks)), 
       fill = cols, 
       title = "Population Density")
```

### `ggplot2`

```{r ggplotexample, eval = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(sf) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = `Population Density`)) +
  theme_void()
```

### `tmap`

```{r tmapexample, eval = TRUE}
library(tmap)

qtm(sf, fill = "Population Density") +
  tm_legend(legend.position = c("left", "top"))
```

### `leaflet`

```{r leafletexample, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

leaflet(sf) %>% 
  addPolygons()
```

```{r saveleafletexample, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# library(leaflet)
# library(mapview)
# 
# mapshot(leaflet(sf) %>% addPolygons(), 
#         file = './leaflet.png')
# 
# #![](leaflet.png){width=400px}

```
